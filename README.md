# Input-Output
My comprehension of input-output theory in C.

First Commit:
I began to learn C in 2020 for a myriad of reasons.For now I will attest my interest in learning the sligthly esoteric principles of computer science. Upon further investigation, I concluded the language of the original Unix family would be the most likely to have greatly influenced the discipline from its inception in the late 60s. One of my advantages was also learning a relatively low-level language compared to my native Python. I will explain substantially more in the future.

Second Commit:
The first file which was written from the "C Programming Language Book". It is a file copying program which specifies the char data type to store character data. Char is applied to return a value that is not confused for a real character. Remember that EOF is an integer defined in the <stdio.h>, which is replacable by any symbolic constant. Another file will be written to explain its logical structure (employed for instruction).

Third Commit:
The iologic.c file is the logical representation of the original input-output program. In the C implementation the getchar() and putchar() functions which are specified in the C standard library for input and output. After the while statement these functions are applied to return the character data.

Fourth Commit:
Character data is often processed in C with the char data type of the functions of the standard input-output library. Most of C's character data is manipulated without the usage of external implementation.

Fifth Commit:
Tomorrow I will include many commits about a recent character counting program taken from "the C: Programming Language".

Sixth Commit:
I have a lot to write. I have completed several programs from "the C:Programming Language". Among these the two are the character and word counting programs. The character counting is similar to the copy program. I will include the file and explain its functionality in the next commit.
