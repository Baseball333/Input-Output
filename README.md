# Input-Output
My comprehension of input-output theory in C.

First Commit:
I began to learn C in 2020 for a myriad of reasons.For now I will attest my interest in learning the sligthly esoteric principles of computer science. Upon further investigation, I concluded the language of the original Unix family would be the most likely to have greatly influenced the discipline from its inception in the late 60s. One of my advantages was also learning a relatively low-level language compared to my native Python. I will explain substantially more in the future.
